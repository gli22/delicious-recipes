        <li>5 whole cloves</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon vanilla extract </li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground cinnamon </li>

        <li>1 ½ cups sugar </li>
        <li>2 ½ cups light rum (optional or to taste) </li>

      <h2>Chapter 3: Directions</h2>
      <p>1.- Heat the milk mixture. In a saucepan, combine milk, cloves, ½ teaspoon vanilla, and cinnamon. Set the heat to the lowest level for five minutes, then slowly bring the mixture to a boil.</p>
      <p>2.- Combine the mixture with egg yolks and sugar. In a separate bowl, combine the egg yolks and sugar. Whisk the two together until they reach a light and fluffy consistency. Very slowly (to avoid scrambled eggs in your eggnog) add the hot milk mixture to your eggs and sugar, whisking it together as your pour. </p>
      <p>3.- Cook the mixture over medium heat and let it cool. Pour the mixture back into the saucepan, and cook over medium heat for three minutes, stirring constantly. Allow the mixture to reach a thick, foamy consistency, but do not boil. Strain the mixture and remove the cloves and any lumps. You'll need to let it cool for about an hour. </p>
      <p>4.- Stir in the remaining ingredients. Add the rum (optional or to taste), 2 teaspoons vanilla, and nutmeg. Stir the mixture together. </p>
      <p>5.-  Refrigerate overnight. Refrigerate your eggnog overnight and serve. Try garnishing it with cinnamon sticks!</p>
